# My Koa2 Starter Kit
This is a Koa2 boilerplate I decided to design to have a better understanding of Koa2. It includes some useful tool, librares and midlewares that can make easy the development of any Koa project. Any suggestion or feedback is welcome.

### Requirements
Be sure to have the following elements installed:
- Node v4.6.0 or greater.
- Nodemon.
- Mocha for unit testing.

### How to use it
1. Download the last release by going to the **releases** tab.
2. Unzip the release zip file in your directory of preference.
3. Run:
sudo npm install
(Don't write sudo if you are on Windows or in sudo mode)
4. Start the project by running:
npm start
or
nodemon
5. Start coding and have fun!
