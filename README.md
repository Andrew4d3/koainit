# My Koa2 Starter Kit
This is a Koa2 boilerplate I decided to design to have a better understanding of Koa2. It includes some useful tool, librares and midlewares that can make easy the development of any Koa project. Any suggestion or feedback is welcome.

### Requirements
Be sure to have the following elements installed:
- Node v4.6.0 or greater.
- Nodemon.
- Mocha for unit testing.

### How to use it
- Download the last release [here](https://github.com/Andrew4d3/koainit/archive/1.0.zip).
- Unzip the release zip file in your directory of preference.
- Run:
```sh
$ sudo npm install
```
(Not need to type sudo if you are on windows or sudo mode)
- Start the project by running:
```sh
$ npm start
```
or
```sh
$ nodemon
```
- Start coding and have fun!
